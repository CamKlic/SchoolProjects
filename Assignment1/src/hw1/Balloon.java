never drop below 0. If the fuel burn rate is more than the available amount of fuel then consume
as much fuel as is available but no more. The temperature inside of the balloon is updated (see
formulas in the Overview section).
The velocity and position of the balloon is also updated based on the formulas. Note that the
calculations for velocity and position at time n depend on the velocity and position at time n-1
(one second ago). In other words, each calculation of velocity and position depends on the
previous calculation.
There are two exceptions to the calculation of the position of the balloon; the balloon can never
drop below ground level (an altitude of 0) and can never rise above the length of the tether. That
is to say, the ground level and the tether length are the minimum and maximum altitudes
respectively. The velocity and altitude can only be calculated after updating the balloon
temperature.
